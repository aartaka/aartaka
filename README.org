#+TITLE:Artyom Bologov, an interface junkie

Hey there! Name's Artyom, and I'm
- Nested
  - lists
    - lover.
- Simple and semantic web design enjoyer.
  - Trying to build UIs and websites (like [[https://aartaka.me][a personal one]]) with as little JavaScript as possible.
    - Preferably none.
      - Yes, it's possible.
  - [[https://aartaka.me/blog/write-hypertext-not-plaintext][Hypertext over any other format]].
- Programmer, [[https://josephg.com/blog/3-tribes/][hacker-poet]], writer, programming language and compiler junkie.
  - Example projects:
    - [[https://github.com/bf-enterprise-solutions][Brainfuck Enterprise Solutions]] with the groundbreaking products like OS.bf and ed.bf.
    - [[https://github.com/aartaka/sade][Sade]], the infinitely optimizable Brainfuck-to-Lisp compiler.
  - Dream projects:
    - an infinitely extensible PDP-8 assembly-like language with Lisp-inspired code-optimizing macros.
- Interface-addicted:
  - mostly muscle memory of Emacs/Nyxt,
  - but also Magit/PureData knowledge domain representation enjoyment.
  - Example projects:
    - [[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt][Nyxt]] as a test bed for all kinds of Design Systems, Malleable Software, and Power-User Design experiments;
    - [[https://github.com/aartaka/graven-image][Graven Image]] as an attempt to make running Lisp image more inspectable.
    - [[https://github.com/aartaka/cl-pure-data][cl-pure-data]] as an attempt to bring/bridge the graphicality of PureData back to the textual coding.
  - Dream projects (i.e. projects I'd love to do but need more knowledge/courage/money (investments/donations welcome) to start):
    - structural code editor for touchscreens, resembling [[https://apkpure.com/hacked/com.hackedapp][/Hacked/ (the Android game)]],
    - no-screen physical interface [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidget_Cube][Fidget Cube computer]], reliant on semantic info extraction from the Web, screen-reader/audio-interfaces research, and pleasant tactile feedback.
- ~(Privacy-|Eco-|FOSS-|Anti-kleptocracy-)~ activist. Ethnically Russian. Struggling with the collective guilt for the war Putin started on 2022 Feb 24th. Envying the post-Soviet countries that have gotten to their political sustainability, hoping for the success of the remaining countries escaping the Communist/Imperialist/Colonial past (Россия Будет Свободной! Слава Україні! Жыве Беларусь!).
  - Dream projects:
    - decentralized/federated (ActivityPub-based?) chat with every message only available to a certain group of people and thus deprecating the concept of chats in favor of direct cocktail-party style communication;
    - fully anonymous plain text chat with no way to trace one's identity (at all).
